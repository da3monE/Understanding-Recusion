# Understanding-Recusion
This project tackles four different implementations of recursion.

The first is using recursion to solve multiple multiplication operations.
The second is reversing a string.
The third is implementing a binary-search of an array.
The fourth is implementing a sequential search of an array.
The final is finding the max value in an array.
